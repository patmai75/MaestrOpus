# MaestrOpus: Subagent Task Manager

**MaestrOpus: Achieving Goals with Opus' Orchestration of Subagents** is an innovative adaptation of the original [Maestro project](https://github.com/Doriandarko/maestro) developed by Pietro Schirano (@skirano). This version extends the original framework to create a more interactive and user-friendly experience through a web application powered by Streamlit.

## Introduction
MaestrOpus is a web application that leverages the power of Claude Opus to orchestrate subagents, breaking down objectives into manageable sub-tasks, executing them with instances of Haiku, Sonnet or Opus, and reviewing the outcomes to achieve a cohesive final result. This adaptation enhances the user interaction by allowing objectives to be set and monitored in real-time through a streamlined interface.
This project is a tribute to the ingenuity of Pietro Schirano's original Maestro, building upon its foundation to explore new possibilities in task orchestration and AI-driven project management.

## Features
- **Interactive Task Management**: Users can input their objectives directly into the web interface and receive updates as tasks are processed.
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Streamlit's web interface offers a user-friendly platform for managing and tracking the progress of tasks.
- **Extended Functionality**: Beyond breaking down objectives and executing sub-tasks, this adaptation incorporates file uploads (text and/or image) for task inputs and offers the option to download detailed task logs.
- **Customizable Subagent Model**: Users have the flexibility to select the most suitable model for the subagent based on their specific requirements.

## Usage
You will be prompted to enter your Anthropic API key and your project's objective. The application allows for the upload of text and image files to provide additional context to your objectives.
